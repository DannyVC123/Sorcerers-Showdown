# Sorcerer’s Showdown

Welcome to **Sorcerer’s Showdown**, a thrilling adventure set in a mystical world. As a young, brave wizard, your task is to defend your castle from the onslaught of mischievous goblins. With your trusty wand, you’ll cast powerful spells to protect the school and its inhabitants.

## Objective
Defeat all the goblins and protect your castle from invasion. Each goblin carries a series of symbols above its head, and you must draw the corresponding shapes in order to cast the correct spell and vanquish them. Be ready for increasingly difficult challenges as you progress through the waves!

## Objects

### Wizard Player Character
A wizard controlled by the player. The wizard moves left or right across the screen and can attack enemies by drawing the correct shapes.

### Goblin Enemies
Various goblin creatures with a series of shapes above their head. Goblins spawn randomly in waves and constantly move toward the player. The player can attack a goblin by drawing the shapes above the enemy on the screen in the given order.

### Shapes
- **Red horizontal line**
- **Blue vertical line**
- **Yellow V**
- **Green upside-down V**

The player draws one of the four shapes to attack an enemy. If the shape is drawn correctly, it lights up with its corresponding color, signaling the spell was successfully cast.

## UI Elements
- **Score Display**
- **3 Lives**
- **Wave Number**
- **Win/Loss Message**

## Player Controls

### Movement
Use the left and right arrow keys or the A and D keys to move in those directions. Move swiftly to dodge goblins!

### Spellcasting
Each goblin you encounter will have one or more symbols above its head. To cast your spell and banish the goblin, hold down the left mouse button and draw the shape of the first symbol that appears above it. As you move the mouse, the shape will be drawn continuously. The drawing is finalized when you release the mouse button. The drawings must be quick and accurate—if you miss a symbol, the goblin will remain and continue attacking.

Some goblins require multiple shapes to be drawn in quick succession. Think fast, as new goblins appear continuously.

You can chain your spells for powerful combo attacks! If multiple goblins share the same first symbol, you can defeat them all at once by drawing that symbol correctly. Use strategy to plan your swipes and attack multiple goblins at once for maximum effect.

## Scoring
Each goblin you defeat is worth 10 points. However, if you manage to defeat 2 or more goblins at once with a single attack, you’ll earn an additional 5 points per goblin in the combo! Plan your attacks carefully to rack up the highest score possible while protecting the kingdom.

## Winning and Losing
Defeat all the goblins and protect your castle. Successfully clear all 5 waves of enemies to restore peace to the kingdom.

You begin with 3 lives. If you take 3 hits, your magic power will run out, and the kingdom will fall. Keep track of your lives and avoid getting overwhelmed to secure your victory!

## Tips
- Stay calm. You’ll need quick reflexes and a steady hand to defeat the more powerful enemies.
- Keep practicing your drawing speed to ensure you can keep up with the increasing number of goblins.
- Experiment with combos to clear waves of goblins faster and rack up points.
